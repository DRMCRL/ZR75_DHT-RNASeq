Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/DRMCRL/ZR75_DHT-RNASeq/tree/dc29668d9d826f9eef2fae8f1b843cd8f32cb15c" target="_blank">dc29668</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/
    Ignored:    .snakemake/

Unstaged changes:
    Modified:   analysis/_site.yml

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="versions" class="tab-pane fade">

<p>
These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were made to the R Markdown (<code>analysis/qc_aligned.Rmd</code>) and HTML (<code>docs/qc_aligned.html</code>) files. If you’ve configured a remote Git repository (see <code>?wflow_git_remote</code>), click on the hyperlinks in the table below to view the files as they were in that past version.

<p>Read assignment to genes was performed using Ensembl release 101 which used the genome build GRCh38 for generation of gene models. When assigning reads to genes, <code>featureCounts</code> was run setting the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Libraries were assumed to be <em>unstranded</em></li>
<li>The <em>minimum percentage</em> of a read which needed to overlap an exon before being counted was 90%</li>
<li>In addition to the minimum percentage, <em>a minimum of 35 bases</em> must also overlap an exon before a read is counted</li>
<li>The <em>minimum alignment quality score</em> for a read to be counted was 1</li>
<li>Counting of multi-mapped reads was permitted using fractional counts</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>The percentages of reads assigned to genes ranged between <em>53%</em> and <em>64%</em></li>
<li>Of the total reads:
<ul>
<li>Between <em>0%</em> and <em>0%</em> were unassigned due to multi-mapping</li>
<li>Between <em>5.5%</em> and <em>9.8%</em> were aligned but didn’t overlap any known genes</li>
<li>Between <em>0.81%</em> and <em>1.38%</em> were unassigned as they failed the proportion overlapping criteria</li>
<li>Between <em>3.9%</em> and <em>5.2%</em> were unassigned as they were considered ambiguous</li>
