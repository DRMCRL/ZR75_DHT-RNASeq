Complete processing and analysis of RNA-Seq data from ZR75 cells.

- Cells were treated with DHT or with Empty Vehicle.
- Sequencing was performed by the Genomics Core Facility in Cambridge (CRUK CI)
- Sequencing data was generated on 19th June, 2013 (20131906) 

As seen in the menus above, pre-processing was performed using an automated `snakemake` workflow, with subsequent analysis performed manually in R.
